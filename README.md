# WebAPI_Angular
This is the .NET Web API solution including Unit Test project.
- Unit test project needs Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Core package to be installed

There are number of improvements that can be made:
- Adding more unit tests
- Improving how service is returning errors to Angular client

# AngularPrj
This folder includes all Angular project files 
Angular Version 8.2.7

There are number of improvements that can be made:
- How Angular service and UI components are handling the errors returned by Web API (for example, Http Interceptor could be used)
- The Web API url must be added to a config file
- Toaster module could be used to display Confirmation and Error messages in a more elegant way
- I'm new to Angular and this was my first attempt at creating an Angular solution from scratch. I'm sure there are many coding standards I haven't followed and 
also I have used JavaScript code in some places that perhaps Angular has modules or better approches to handle the same scenario

Thanks!
