# WebAPI_Angular
This is the .net webapi solution includinmg unit test project

There are number of improvements that can be made:
- adding more unit tests
- improving how service is returning errors to Angular client

# AngularPrj
This folder includes all Angular project files 
Angular Version 8.2.7

There are number of improvements that can be made:
- How Angular service and UI components are handling the errors returned by WebApi (for example, Http Interceptor could be used)
- I'm new to Angular and this was my first attempt, so I'm sure there are many coding standards I haven't followed and 
also I have used JavaScript code in some places that perhaps Angular has modules or better approches to handle the same scenario
- The WebPi url must be added to a config file

Thanks!
